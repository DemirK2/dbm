# DBM Window / Bot Logs are off screen 
Sometimes when you open a program in windows it appears off screen. 

## To fix:
1. Hold the `Shift` key on your keyboard and right click the program in your taskbar. 
2. Choose `Maximize`
3. Grab the top toolbar of the program and click & drag to move the window back onto your main monitor. 

Note: There is also an option under the DBM Project menu to "Reset Bot Log Position", but this only works for the log.
