# How to take a Screenshot in Windows 
When requesting support in Discord (or the forums) you will most likely be asked to send a screenshot of what you are seeing. Please, for the love of sanity DO NOT use your phone to take a photo of your screen, most of the time this is unreadable and we really don't want to try and see your program through the glare or fog.

There are three main methods of taking a screenshot in windows:
## Using the Snipping Tool  
1. Click on the windows menu button (or hit the Menu key on your keyboard) and type `Snipping`. You should see the Snipping tool pop up as the first result:
